# mks66-final-project
## Maryann Foley and Horace Fusco

#### Features we implemented
- Phong and Gouraud shading
- Mesh
  - Reading obj files that contain both triangle and quadrilaterals
  - Added a feature that "cleans up" obj files (makes it so that only vertex and face lines remain)
    - Requires user to go into script and add a third parameter to add_mesh that is what they want to name the new file (without the ".obj")
